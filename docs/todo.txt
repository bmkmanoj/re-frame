* Evaluate performance of naive subscriptions implementation. A lookup table would
  likely be better for tracking subscriptions, but at what point?
* More detailed investigation around timing functions for nextTick
* Implement `on-changes` interceptor
* Make terminology consistent, e.g. "fx" vs "effects"
* Debug tracing
* Should context -> interceptors be considered immutable? Much nicer to work with when mutable.
