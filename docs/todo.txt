* Subscription .id and .args is gross. Think more.

---- [ Performance ] ----------------------------
* Evaluate performance of naive subscriptions implementation. A lookup table would
  likely be better for tracking subscriptions, but at what point?

---- [ Features ] -------------------------------
* More detailed investigation around timing functions for nextTick
* Implement `debug` interceptor
* Implement `enrich` interceptor
* Implement `after` interceptor
* Implement `on-changes` interceptor

---- [ Docs ] -----------------------------------
* Stress that everything is just an interceptor

---- [ Ergonomics ] -----------------------------
* Make terminology consistent, e.g. "fx" vs "effects"
* Possible to make public API pithier?
* Debug tracing
