* make terminology consistent, e.g. "fx" vs "effects"
  -- possible to make public API pithier?
* implement `debug` interceptor
* implement `enrich` interceptor
* implement `after` interceptor
* implement `on-changes` interceptor
* more detailed investigation around timing functions for nextTick
* dispatchSync
* should event handlers only take payload (not event vector)?
  -- vector is consistent with clj re-frame, but I don't see purpose
* strict mode?
  - validate interceptor is not nil
  - validate interceptor has been called (is not a function)
* tracing

--- docs
* move redux comparison to separate doc
* stress that everything is just an interceptor

---

* should `dispatch` support unwrapped events? e.g. dispatch(string, payload)
